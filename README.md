# TAOCP - The Art Of Computer Programming Reading Group Meetup

https://www.meetup.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/

## Description

We are devoted to reading, understanding and working through The Art Of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth (TAOCP). We go through a portion of TAOCP at each meetup. Text is read out and discussed. We work on some simple and medium exercises.

The world is fortunate that over 50 years ago a person like Donald Knuth undertook an epic quest of bringing "readers to the frontiers of knowledge in every [computer science] subject that was treated". Later realizing that "the rapid rise of computer science made such a dream impossible", he decided to "concentrate on classic techniques that are likely to remain important for many more decades, and to describe them as well as [he could]".

We strongly believe Knuth has gathered timeless concepts and explained them with great flair. The material is detailed and rigorous and leavened with humor.

If you feel the same way or would like to know why the ACM Turing Award cited Knuth's TAOCP as having "served as a focal point for developing curricula and as an organizing influence on computer science", please join us in our endeavor to study and learn from TAOCP in a systematic and regular manner.

Anyone may join from anywhere. No programming knowledge is required.

## All Meetups

Past and future meetups in reverse chronological order

### TAOCP #21 - Path Length In Trees (Chapter 2, Information Structures: Section 2.3.4.5)

**Date:** TBD\
**Time:** TBD

**This event will be recorded and posted to YouTube as a public video at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOHy9Rjl3MlEfZ2HI0AD3g**

Google Meet link will be updated here and sent to attendees before the meeting.

#### Agenda

**2:00 - 2:10** Meet and greet\
**2:10 - 3:00** Read and discuss couple pages at a time from *Chapter 2, Information Structures* (along with *MMIX Supplement*)

- *2.3 Trees* (pp.399-404)
  - *2.3.4.5 Path Length* (pp.399-404)

**3:00 - 3:10** Break\
**3:10 - 4:00** *Exercises* (pp.404-406), shoot the breeze

Binary Trees!

**Note on MMIX and MIX**

The **MMIX** is a hypothetical computer designed by Knuth. It is a successor to **MIX** which is still referred to in all printings of Vols. 1-3 of TAOCP. **MMIX** is significantly different from **MIX**. In order to use **MMIX** instead of **MIX** now means having to supplement TAOCP with two primary sources.

The first supplement is *Fascicle 1, MMIX*, a booklet written by Knuth describing the computer and its assembly programming language. It replaces Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*. The section numbers in the fascicle have a prime (') suffix to distinguish them from the originals, e.g. fascicle section 1.3.1' replaces TAOCP section 1.3.1.

The second supplement is *The MMIX Supplement* by Martin Ruckert that has **MMIX** versions of all programs and content in TAOCP that currently refer to the older **MIX** computer. It uses the same section numbers as in TAOCP with page references and text snippets from TAOCP to help sync the **MMIX** version of the content with its location in TAOCP.

### TAOCP #20 - Other Representations Of Trees (Chapter 2, Information Structures: Section 2.3.3)

Data structures - Yay!

We begin to look at representing and manipulating tabular arrangements of data in programs. A table that is laid out in a linear manner is known as a list or array. Three simple and pervasive data structures - stacks, queues and deques - are introduced. We'll examine their structural differences and how it affects their application to different problems.

We'll also introduce *The MMIX Supplement*. We'll be using it as a companion text to TAOCP Volumes 1-3 for all future meetups. It has **MMIX** variants of code in TAOCP.

After the break, we'll do some exercises.

**Note on MMIX and MIX**

The **MMIX** is a hypothetical computer designed by Knuth. It is a successor to **MIX** which is still referred to in all printings of Vols. 1-3 of TAOCP. **MMIX** is significantly different from **MIX**. In order to use **MMIX** instead of **MIX** now means having to supplement TAOCP with two primary sources.

The first supplement is *Fascicle 1, MMIX*, a booklet written by Knuth describing the computer and its assembly programming language. It replaces Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*. The section numbers in the fascicle have a prime (') suffix to distinguish them from the originals, e.g. fascicle section 1.3.1' replaces TAOCP section 1.3.1.

The second supplement is *The MMIX Supplement* by Martin Ruckert that has **MMIX** versions of all programs and content in TAOCP that currently refer to the older **MIX** computer. It uses the same section numbers as in TAOCP with page references and text snippets from TAOCP to help sync the **MMIX** version of the content with its location in TAOCP.

We begin to program the **MMIX** computer!

Programs for **MMIX** are written in assembly language. An assembly language program is made up of a sequence of **MMIX** instructions plus directives for the assembly language processing program called the assembler. The output of the assembler is an object file that can actually run on the **MMIX**.

The first program we'll study finds the maximum of some numbers. Its code is in *Fascicle 1, MMIX* but the algorithm is in *TAOCP Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*.

Two programs that print output follow, completing our introduction to **MMIX**. This lets us tackle basic algorithms and data structures from Chapters 2 and 5 right away. We'll swing back at some point to cover the few remaining **MMIX** features like subroutines, coroutines and interrupts as needed.

First is the requisite "Hello World" program. It's short and sweet.

Then there's a program to compute small primes and print them in a table. It introduces some interesting features of **MMIX** assembly like local symbols and symbolic expressions.

We'll step through each program in the MMIX Visual Debugger to see it in action.

After the break, we'll do some exercises.

Exercises are posted at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/exercises/tree/master/fasc_1_mmix_chap_1_basic_concepts/sec_1.3.2_the_mmix_assembly_language - anyone may contribute solutions or partial work to the repo at any time.

We wrap up the **MMIX** instruction set!

We learn that many instructions can take constants instead of registers as operands. This is often a nice convenience that allows small values to be used for arithmetic or for relative addressing. It also allows a register to be set to any value without loading data from memory.

Then we learn instructions to branch and jump. These are the basis of essential programming control constructs like **if-else** conditions and **while** loops. This will allow us to finally study and write complete programs for an **MMIX** computer.

We'll go over the costs of the entire **MMIX** instruction set. This lets us estimate the performance of a program and compare the speed of two programs.

After the break, we'll work on exercises on the new instructions and those from previous meetups on **MMIX**.

MMIX exercises galore!

We've covered the bulk of instructions for the **MMIX** computer. We've tried out examples in the MMIX Visual Debugger. But nothing like working on a lot of problems to truly strengthen our grasp of the material. This event is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of **MMIX**. Equally we want to share our work with the group and help others with any questions.  It's also a chance for anyone who missed a session on **MMIX** to catch up.

We're dedicating the full two hours to solving exercises from *Fascicle 1, MMIX*. The format is rather free-form. A restricted Google Doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUjM3CUOlHYBdgC7QOUENwP3IAk07tYx0GiFzO5cleo/edit?usp=sharing with many exercises is now available on request for members to work in and collaborate with the group. We'll work collectively and individually in parallel to attempt as many exercises as possible. And share solutions or partial work with everyone. Afterwards all our work will be posted to the meetup's Github repos for notes and exercises.

It's better not to look at the answers to exercises. Instead members are encouraged to ask questions and enter comments into the shared doc or the chat panel. Every note that reflects genuine individual thought could be useful to people who come across it in the future.

We cover more of the instruction set architecture of **MMIX** from *Fascicle 1, MMIX*. We'll also need to consult *TAOCP, Chapter 1* for a little section on the mathematical basis for the `DIV` instruction.

We'll start with instructions for simple arithmetic. We'll learn how to compare values. We'll see instructions for working with the bits and bytes in registers.

After the break, we'll use the free and open source MMIX Visual Debugger https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd introduced in TAOCP Meetup #3 for hands-on practice with the instructions we have learnt so far. We'll work on some exercises too.

We introduce the MMIX computer used throughout TAOCP!

Algorithms in TAOCP are described in pseudocode and implemented as programs written in assembly language for the MMIX computer. But an MMIX computer has never been manufactured. It can only be used in simulator programs. Outside of TAOCP, there are almost no code examples, guides, tutorials or videos. This can be a dealbreaker for many people used to an abundance of information for other programming languages readily available at popular websites.

The next few TAOCP meetups will cover enough of MMIX to attain a working knowledge sufficient to read and write simple programs. Side by side we will learn to use tools to run and debug our programs. Hopefully by the time we're done, our meetup notes, discussions and videos will lower the barrier to learning and working with MMIX.

In this first meetup on MMIX, we learn how data is represented and stored in MMIX memory. Data is operated upon using instructions from the MMIX instruction set. We'll start with instructions for moving data between memory and registers where data may be manipulated. We'll continue with more instructions in the following meetups.

We'll begin to use some invaluable tools for working with MMIX in the second half of the meetup. We'll see how to use the MMIX Visual Debugger GUI https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd to edit, run and step through MMIX assembly language programs. The MMIX simulator and assembler https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src are commandline tools that will be demoed in upcoming meetups. All these tools are free and open source.

Well - We begin reading TAOCP in earnest today!

As its title suggests, TAOCP is about three things - "Art", "Computers" and "Programming". Knuth spoke at length on "Art" in his Turing Award lecture https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283929. Today we look at the foundation of "Programming" that is built upon the concept of an algorithm. And we'll spend time on "Computers" in the coming sessions.

### TAOCP #1 - Inaugural Meeting

**Date:** Saturday, 5 September 2020<br>
**Time:** 2-4pm America/New_York

#### Agenda

**2:00 - 2:10** Meet and greet<br>
**2:10 - 3:00** Read and discuss couple pages at a time of *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*

-  *Preface* (pp.v-xi)
-  *Procedure for Reading* (pp.xii-xiv)

**3:00 - 3:10** Break<br>
**3:10 - 4:00** Meetup structure and schedule, shoot the breeze<br>

All - Welcome to the inaugural organizational meeting!

We'll start with reading the prefatory sections to *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*. We'll go over logistics and the regular schedule.

A tentative schedule is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/meetup.

Each meeting will be two hours long with a 10-minute break after the first hour. We'll aim to read just a few pages of the book in the first half. Typically we'll have around 5-10 minutes to read 1-2 pages and everyone will be encouraged to enter comments, questions and thoughts in the Meet chat. Then we'll go over chat comments and discuss the text we just read for 5-10 minutes. Then we'll move on to the next couple pages.

The goal is to read with understanding, counting on the support of the entire group but not to get stuck on anything. The material can be very dense and difficult to absorb right away. If something does not click despite the discussion, there will be time in the second half for clarification when we attempt some exercises. Yet sometimes it could take a day or two for things to sink in after revisiting the material.

The second half of the meeting will be reserved for exercises and more free-form discussion of current or previous topics. Knuth has a difficulty rating for every exercise. The rating also includes a mathematical level indicator. We will attempt a few of the exercises rated *Simple* or *Medium*. We may try some of the mathematical exercises from time to time especially if the topic demands it. Here too we'd like to work out some problems as a group but not obsess over any single exercise or solution.

A shared Google Doc will be available during and for some time after the meeting for every attendee to add their own notes. Later, the doc with everybody's notes will be posted to the meetup github repo and may be edited via pull requests.

A separate repo for member solutions to exercises is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/exercises

It is my hope to build a permanent resource of our meeting recordings, notes and exercise solutions to help anyone who'd like to study TAOCP. More immediately it's meant to aid members who miss a meeting to catch up on their own.
