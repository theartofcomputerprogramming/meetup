# TAOCP - The Art Of Computer Programming Reading Group Meetup

https://www.meetup.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/

## Description

We are devoted to reading, understanding and working through The Art Of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth (TAOCP). We go through a portion of TAOCP at each meetup. Text is read out and discussed. We work on some simple and medium exercises.

The world is fortunate that over 50 years ago a person like Donald Knuth undertook an epic quest of bringing "readers to the frontiers of knowledge in every [computer science] subject that was treated". Later realizing that "the rapid rise of computer science made such a dream impossible", he decided to "concentrate on classic techniques that are likely to remain important for many more decades, and to describe them as well as [he could]".

We strongly believe Knuth has gathered timeless concepts and explained them with great flair. The material is detailed and rigorous yet abounds with wit and humor - not unsurprising coming from the inventor of a new system of measurement for Mad magazine https://www.madcoversite.com/mad033.html.

If you feel the same way or would like to know why the ACM Turing Award cited Knuth's TAOCP as having "served as a focal point for developing curricula and as an organizing influence on computer science", please join us in our endeavor to study and learn from TAOCP in a systematic and regular manner.

Anyone may join from anywhere. No programming knowledge is required.
