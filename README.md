# TAOCP - The Art Of Computer Programming Reading Group Meetup

https://www.meetup.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/

## Description

We are devoted to reading, understanding and working through The Art Of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth (TAOCP). We go through a portion of TAOCP at each meetup. Text is read out and discussed. We work on some simple and medium exercises.

The world is fortunate that over 50 years ago a person like Donald Knuth undertook an epic quest of bringing "readers to the frontiers of knowledge in every [computer science] subject that was treated". Later realizing that "the rapid rise of computer science made such a dream impossible", he decided to "concentrate on classic techniques that are likely to remain important for many more decades, and to describe them as well as [he could]".

We strongly believe Knuth has gathered timeless concepts and explained them with great flair. The material is detailed and rigorous and leavened with humor.

If you feel the same way or would like to know why the ACM Turing Award cited Knuth's TAOCP as having "served as a focal point for developing curricula and as an organizing influence on computer science", please join us in our endeavor to study and learn from TAOCP in a systematic and regular manner.

Anyone may join from anywhere. No programming knowledge is required.

Past and future meetups in reverse chronological order

### TAOCP #21 - Path Length In Trees (Chapter 2, Information Structures: Section 2.3.4.5)

**Date:** TBD<br>
**Time:** TBD

**This event will be recorded and posted to YouTube as a public video at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOHy9Rjl3MlEfZ2HI0AD3g**

Google Meet link will be updated here and sent to attendees before the meeting.

#### Agenda

**2:00 - 2:10** Meet and greet<br>
**2:10 - 3:00** Read and discuss couple pages at a time from *Chapter 2, Information Structures* (along with *MMIX Supplement*)

- *2.3 Trees* (pp.399-404)
  - *2.3.4.5 Path Length* (pp.399-404)

**3:00 - 3:10** Break<br>
**3:10 - 4:00** *Exercises* (pp.404-406), shoot the breeze<br>

Binary Trees!

**Note on MMIX and MIX**

The **MMIX** is a hypothetical computer designed by Knuth. It is a successor to **MIX** which is still referred to in all printings of Vols. 1-3 of TAOCP. **MMIX** is significantly different from **MIX**. In order to use **MMIX** instead of **MIX** now means having to supplement TAOCP with two primary sources.

The first supplement is *Fascicle 1, MMIX*, a booklet written by Knuth describing the computer and its assembly programming language. It replaces Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*. The section numbers in the fascicle have a prime (') suffix to distinguish them from the originals, e.g. fascicle section 1.3.1' replaces TAOCP section 1.3.1.

The second supplement is *The MMIX Supplement* by Martin Ruckert that has **MMIX** versions of all programs and content in TAOCP that currently refer to the older **MIX** computer. It uses the same section numbers as in TAOCP with page references and text snippets from TAOCP to help sync the **MMIX** version of the content with its location in TAOCP.

### TAOCP #20 - Other Representations Of Trees (Chapter 2, Information Structures: Section 2.3.3)

Data structures - Yay!

We begin with sequential arrangements of data known as lists or arrays. Three simple and pervasive data structures - stacks, queues and deques - are introduced.

We'll need to start using *The MMIX Supplement*. It will remain a companion to TAOCP Volumes 1-3 in all future meetups. It has **MMIX** variants of code in TAOCP.

**Note on MMIX and MIX**

The **MMIX** is a hypothetical computer designed by Knuth. It is a successor to **MIX** which is still referred to in all printings of Vols. 1-3 of TAOCP. **MMIX** is significantly different from **MIX**. In order to use **MMIX** instead of **MIX** now means having to supplement TAOCP with two primary sources.

The first supplement is *Fascicle 1, MMIX*, a booklet written by Knuth describing the computer and its assembly programming language. It replaces Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*. The section numbers in the fascicle have a prime (') suffix to distinguish them from the originals, e.g. fascicle section 1.3.1' replaces TAOCP section 1.3.1.

The second supplement is *The MMIX Supplement* by Martin Ruckert that has **MMIX** versions of all programs and content in TAOCP that currently refer to the older **MIX** computer. It uses the same section numbers as in TAOCP with page references and text snippets from TAOCP to help sync the **MMIX** version of the content with its location in TAOCP.

We begin to program the **MMIX** computer!

We'll begin with learning instructions to branch and jump. These are the basis of essential programming control constructs like **if-else** conditions and **while** loops. This will allow us to finally study a complete program for an **MMIX** computer.

Programs for **MMIX** are written in assembly language. An assembly language program is made up of a sequence of **MMIX** instructions plus directives for the assembly language processing program called the assembler. The output of the assembler is an object file that can actually run on the **MMIX**.

The first program we'll study finds the maximum of some numbers. Its code is in *Fascicle 1, MMIX* but we will also look up the corresponding algorithm in *TAOCP Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*.

After the break, we'll step through the program in the MMIX Visual Debugger https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd. We'll also learn to use the **MMIX** simulator `mmmix` and the **MMIX** assembler `mmixal` https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src to work with **MMIX** programs on the commandline.

We cover more of the instruction set architecture of **MMIX**. We'll start with instructions for simple arithmetic. We'll learn how to compare values. We'll see instructions for working with the bits and bytes in registers. We'll see how to directly use constant values to set parts of a register.

After the break, we'll use the MMIX Visual Debugger https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd introduced in TAOCP Meetup #2 to get hands-on practice with the instructions we have learnt so far. We'll work on some exercises too.

We introduce the MMIX computer used throughout TAOCP!

Algorithms in TAOCP are described in pseudocode and implemented as programs written in assembly language for the MMIX computer. But an MMIX computer has never been manufactured. It can only be used in simulator programs. Outside of TAOCP, there are almost no code examples, guides, tutorials or videos. This can be a dealbreaker for many people used to an abundance of information for other programming languages readily available at popular websites.

The next few TAOCP meetups will cover enough of MMIX to attain a working knowledge sufficient to read and write simple programs. Side by side we will learn to use tools to run and debug our programs. Hopefully by the time we're done, our meetup notes, discussions and videos will lower the barrier to learning and working with MMIX.

In this first meetup on MMIX, we learn how data is represented and stored in MMIX memory. Data is operated upon using instructions from the MMIX instruction set. We'll start with instructions for moving data between memory and registers where data may be manipulated. We'll continue with more instructions in the following meetups.

We'll begin to use some invaluable tools for working with MMIX in the second half of the meetup. We'll see how to use the MMIX Visual Debugger GUI https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd to edit, run and step through MMIX assembly language programs. The MMIX simulator and assembler https://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src are commandline tools that will be demoed in upcoming meetups. All these tools are available for Linux, Windows and Mac.

Well - We begin reading TAOCP in earnest today!

As its title suggests, TAOCP is about three things - "Art", "Computers" and "Programming". Knuth spoke at length on "Art" in his Turing Award lecture https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283929. Today we look at the foundation of "Programming" that is built upon the concept of an algorithm. And we'll spend time on "Computers" in the coming sessions.

### TAOCP #1 - Inaugural Meeting

**Date:** Saturday, 5 September 2020<br>
**Time:** 2-4pm America/New_York

**This event will be recorded and posted to YouTube as a public video at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOHy9Rjl3MlEfZ2HI0AD3g**

Google Meet link will be updated here and sent to attendees before the meeting.

#### Agenda

**2:00 - 2:10** Meet and greet<br>
**2:10 - 3:00** Read and discuss couple pages at a time of *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*

-  *Preface* (pp.v-xi)
-  *Procedure for Reading* (pp.xii-xiv)
-  *Notes on Exercises* (pp.xv-xvii)

**3:00 - 3:10** Break<br>
**3:10 - 4:00** Meetup structure and schedule, shoot the breeze<br>

All - Welcome to the inaugural organizational meeting!

We'll start with reading the prefatory sections to *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*. We'll go over logistics and the regular schedule.

A tentative schedule is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/meetup.

Each meeting will be two hours long with a 10-minute break after the first hour. We'll aim to read just a few pages of the book in the first half. Typically we'll have around 5-10 minutes to read 1-2 pages and everyone will be encouraged to enter comments, questions and thoughts in the Meet chat. Then we'll go over chat comments and discuss the text we just read for 5-10 minutes. Then we'll move on to the next couple pages.

The goal is to read with understanding, counting on the support of the entire group but not to get stuck on anything. The material can be very dense and difficult to absorb right away. If something does not click despite the discussion, there will be time in the second half for clarification when we attempt some exercises. Yet sometimes it could take a day or two for things to sink in after revisiting the material.

The second half of the meeting will be reserved for exercises and more free-form discussion of current or previous topics. Knuth has a difficulty rating for every exercise. The rating also includes a mathematical level indicator. We will attempt a few of the exercises rated *Simple* or *Medium*. We may try some of the mathematical exercises from time to time especially if the topic demands it. Here too we'd like to work out some problems as a group but not obsess over any single exercise or solution.

A shared Google Doc will be available during and for some time after the meeting for every attendee to add their own notes. Later, the doc with everybody's notes will be posted to the meetup github repo and may be edited via pull requests.

A separate repo for member solutions to exercises is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/exercises

It is my hope to build a permanent resource of our meeting recordings, notes and exercise solutions to help anyone who'd like to study TAOCP. More immediately it's meant to aid members who miss a meeting to catch up on their own.
