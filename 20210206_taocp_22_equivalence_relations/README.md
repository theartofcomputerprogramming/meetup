# TAOCP #22 - Equivalence Relations (Chapter 2, Information Structures: Section 2.3.3)

Trees in memory!

We look at ways to represent a binary tree in memory in section 2.3.3 Other Representations of Trees.

Knuth's fascinating coverage begins with the pros and cons of a few sequential representation techniques. We see one of these - postorder with degrees - applied to the bottom-up evaluation of functions in Algorithm F (Evaluate a locally defined function in a tree).

Then we discuss linked representations. An application based on oriented trees is shown in Algorithm E (Process equivalence relations)

We'll do some exercises

**Note on MMIX and MIX**

The **MMIX** is a hypothetical computer designed by Knuth. It is a successor to **MIX** which is still referred to in all printings of Vols. 1-3 of TAOCP. **MMIX** is significantly different from **MIX**. In order to use **MMIX** instead of **MIX** now means having to supplement TAOCP with two primary sources.

The first supplement is *Fascicle 1, MMIX*, a booklet written by Knuth describing the computer and its assembly programming language. It replaces Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*. The section numbers in the fascicle have a prime (') suffix to distinguish them from the originals, e.g. fascicle section 1.3.1' replaces TAOCP section 1.3.1.

The second supplement is *The MMIX Supplement* by Martin Ruckert that has **MMIX** versions of all programs and content in TAOCP that currently refer to the older **MIX** computer. It uses the same section numbers as in TAOCP with page references and text snippets from TAOCP to help sync the **MMIX** version of the content with its location in TAOCP.

the orthogonal binary tree diagram in (2) on p.349 is what Knuth calls the natural correspondence of ""general" trees/forests and binary trees

Btw, "Î›" is how Knuth spells "the null pointer"

**Zartaj Majeed** 2:34 PM\
exercise 2.4.12 given as an application of SCOPEd representation has to do with symbol table lookups from what I gather

Page 350: What is a "family" again?

**Zartaj Majeed** 2:50 PM\
I think it's the family tree\

Bottom of page 352 also uses "family" in the sense of "set of siblings." So I guess that's pretty well established as Knuth's intended meaning.
