# TAOCP #1 - Inaugural Meeting

**Date:** Saturday, 5 September 2020<br>
**Time:** 2-4pm America/New_York<br>
**Location:** Google Meet online

## Agenda

**2:00 - 2:10** Meet and greet<br>
**2:10 - 3:00** Read and discuss couple pages at a time of *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*

-  *Preface* (pp.v-xi)
-  *Procedure for Reading* (pp.xii-xiv)
-  *Notes on Exercises* (pp.xv-xvii)

**3:00 - 3:10** Break<br>
**3:10 - 4:00** Meetup structure and schedule, shoot the breeze<br>

All - Welcome to the inaugural organizational meeting!

We'll start with reading the prefatory sections to *Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms*. We'll go over logistics and the regular schedule.

A tentative schedule is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/meetup.

Each meeting will be two hours long with a 10-minute break after the first hour. We'll aim to read just a few pages of the book in the first half. Typically we'll have around 5-10 minutes to read 1-2 pages and everyone will be encouraged to enter comments, questions and thoughts in the Meet chat. Then we'll go over chat comments and discuss the text we just read for 5-10 minutes. Then we'll move on to the next couple pages.

The goal is to read with understanding, counting on the support of the entire group but not to get stuck on anything. The material can be very dense and difficult to absorb right away. If something does not click despite the discussion, there will be time in the second half for clarification when we attempt some exercises. Yet sometimes it could take a day or two for things to sink in after revisiting the material.

The second half of the meeting will be reserved for exercises and more free-form discussion of current or previous topics. Knuth has a difficulty rating for every exercise. The rating also includes a mathematical level indicator. We will attempt a few of the exercises rated *Simple* or *Medium*. We may try some of the mathematical exercises from time to time especially if the topic demands it. Here too we'd like to work out some problems as a group but not obsess over any single exercise or solution.

A shared Google Doc will be available during and for some time after the meeting for every attendee to add their own notes. Later, the doc with everybody's notes will be posted to the meetup github repo and may be edited via pull requests.

A separate repo for member solutions to exercises is available at https://github.com/theartofcomputerprogramming/exercises

It is my hope to build a permanent resource of our meeting recordings, notes and exercise solutions to help anyone who'd like to study TAOCP. More immediately it's meant to aid members who miss a meeting to catch up on their own.

Hope everyone's holding up okay! Google Meetings doesn't want my camera to work today.

**James Curran** 2:06 PM<br>
I'm in Bloomfield (NJ) (between Newark & Montclair)

**Alan Lin** 2:06 PM<br>

**Alan Lin** 2:07 PM<br>
Watchung is Somerset county which is in North-Central New Jersey

**Michael Zalewski** 2:09 PM<br>
I'll be impressed if we cover any significant portion of it

**James Curran** 2:09 PM<br>
Since the parsing/compile sections haven''t  been written yet, I'm looking forward to the searching

**Thomson Kneeland** 2:09 PM<br>
graph theory/combinatorics algos

**David Barker** 2:09 PM<br>
I’m looking forward to the exercises

**Zartaj Majeed** 2:09 PM<br>
I was mainly motivated by learning about SAT solvers

**Peter M** 2:10 PM<br>
I see a note in my copy at the section of directed acyclic graphs which I ended up using in several projects in finance

**Peter M** 2:13 PM<br>
last time i used assembly language was on a PDP-11 at the University of Wisconsin. From then on it was C, C++, Java, C# but I am looking forward to use MIX

**Peter M** 2:17 PM<br>
One of my CS professors said that the K in Knuth is silent.

**Arthur O'Dwyer** 2:18 PM<br>
I know I've heard from Knuth himself whether it's silent or not, but I have forgotten the answer. :) Consensus is definitely "non-silent" though.

**Peter M** 2:19 PM<br>
His Stanford U page says it is pronounced Ka-NOOTH. I should have checked that first
 

**Michael Zalewski** 2:20 PM<br>
You can get the PDF from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manjunath5496/The-Art-of-Computer-Programming-Books/master/aoc(5).pdf
(Since mine was drowned by Hurricane Irene several years ago)

**Arthur O'Dwyer** 2:21 PM<br>
Btw, the preface in my Third Edition goes all the way to page xi. Is the intent that we stop around the "outline of volumes 1-5"?

**James Curran** 2:22 PM<br>
2nd edition -- preface goes to xiii

**Peter M** 2:26 PM<br>
Exactly - In 1968/1973 when the first edition was written writing a program was an afternoon at the IBM punch card machine
 

**James Curran** 2:37 PM<br>
Comparing my book (2nd ed) with the PDF (3rd ed), he deleted an entire page just from that selection (I'm on page x now)

**amal** 2:38 PM<br>
glad he didn't go with dynamic programming

**Peter M** 2:39 PM<br>
One of his contributions that first struck me was defining whether an a solution of a problem was NP-complete, ie could it be solved in finite time
nondeterministic polynomial time

**David Barker** 2:42 PM<br>
I am reading on the O’Reilly site and there are no page numbers.  Headings with page numbers would help.

**Arthur O'Dwyer** 2:44 PM<br>

**Thomson Kneeland** 2:57 PM<br>
There's a great 2hr interview with Knuth done by Lex Fridman recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdBfsXbST8&t=3454s&ab_channel=LexFridman

**James Curran** 2:58 PM<br>
I really like PL/I for the one college class I used it for (never after that)
If you made a syntax error in PL/I, it would just gues what you meant (often wrong)

**James Curran** 2:59 PM<br>
He's 82!
 
# Zartaj

Zartaj's notes

p.v:
four prerequisites
have written four programs - agree/disagree?
my take: addressed to individual reader studying on their own or in academic environment
I believe meetup group support, structure and timeline can help motivated people meet missing prereqs along the way
will have written 4 programs when done with intro to MMIX

p.vi:
analysis of algorithms meaning “the theory of the properties of particular computer algorithms"
theory... properties... particular...
what properties? better, worse, in what sense, by how much, when, correctness? coverage of problem space?

p.vii:
outline: volume 4!
original goal
classic techniques - agree/disagree?

p.viii
hardest decision
programming language
ideal computer MIX

p.ix:
"definitely the correct choice" - agree/disagree?
notice volume 4 so far has very few to no programs - speculation why?
